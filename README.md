# Azure Hackbook 👩‍💻👨‍💻

**Azure Hackbook** is a go-to-guide for any developer to get to *learn and build scalable solutions at hackathons* on Azure. This hackbook is never finished! It's an ongoing project for the developers that we're always trying to update as we run more and more hackathons.

## Hacking with Microsoft Azure ☁️

### What is Azure?
Microsoft Azure is a *flexible*, *scalable*, and *full-featured* cloud platform. If you can imagine it, you can build it on Azure, using the tools, languages and frameworks you're already familiar with. Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET - you can run them all on Azure!

Using Azure you can run serverless code using Azure Functions, host web applications and databases, take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) through Cognitive Services, and create your own machine learning models through Azure Notebooks or powerful Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVM).

**If you're new to Azure, we have a host of learning options available to you.**

### AI + Machine Learning ⌛ 

The AI Services in Azure bring the *best of AI to Azure* and the *best of Azure to AI*.
It is about bringing the state of the art technology as easy to use cloud services for developers.
It’s also about taking advantage of the best capabilities that the cloud has to offer, such as hardware and microservice clusters to make AI scalable.


There are 3 sets of AI services in Azure. 
1. **Pre-built AI capabilities**, such as Cognitive Service APIs for speech, language understanding, OCR, vision and Search are simple cloud hosted functions.

2. Conversational AI is now easy with the **Azure Bot Service**. It allows you to build and deploy chat and conversational applications with ease.

3. When you have to build a deeply custom AI model with your own data, **[Azure Machine Learning - aka.ms/HN/AIonAzure](https://aka.ms/HN/AIonAzure)** provides all you need for cloud scale algorithm and model development.

### Compute 💻

#### Azure App Service

Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers auto-scaling and high availability, supports both Windows and Linux, and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo. Learn how to use Azure App Service with our quickstarts, tutorials, and samples.

#### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

The fully managed Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) makes deploying and managing containerised applications easy. It offers serverless Kubernetes, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience and enterprise-grade security and governance. Unite your development and operations teams on a single platform to rapidly build, deliver and scale applications with confidence.
